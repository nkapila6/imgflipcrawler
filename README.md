# imgflipcrawler
An ImgFlip meme crawler made using bs4. FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, use their API for any use case.

Made this originally for my [MCP server](https://github.com/nkapila6/mcp-meme-sticky/) until I realized they have a [free API to use](https://imgflip.com/api).

This crawler is for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**, use their [free API](https://imgflip.com/api) for any use case.

The crawler is heavily inspired from [icrawler](https://icrawler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
